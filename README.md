# FASHION PRODUCT CLASSIFIER 
Fashion is the way we present ourselves which mainly focuses on vision, has attracted great interest from computer vision researchers. It is generally used to search fashion products in online shopping malls to know the descriptive information of the product. The main objectives of our paper is to use deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) methods to correctly identify and categorize clothing images. In this work, we used ML algorithms (support vector machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neirghbors (KNN), Decision tree (DT), Random Forest (RF)), DL algorithms (Convolutionnal Neurals Network (CNN), AlexNet, GoogleNet, LeNet, LeNet5) and the transfer learning using a pretrained models (
